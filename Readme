Singaporeans face issues assimilating back into Singapore. Its ironic that Singaporeans dread coming back home. Thus to support our fellow Singaporeans, we decided to create a mobile app to assist their move, way before they return from abroad.

ALWAYS SG addresses the key concerns Singaporeans face when returning namely, Job, Education and Housing. This app provides a one stop portal for quick and convenient services connecting to relevant agents for a hassle-free move.

We used Figma to prototype the design and Python to display some of the interesting features included in the app.

It was our first time experimenting with the use of platforms like Figma and Tkinter thus there was a lot of trial and error done to make things work and orientate ourselves around the software. We faced coding difficulties and a huge time constraint but here we present our best work within such a short time frame.

We are happy to have learnt and grown through the entire process of ideating, creating and prototyping solutions to address our problem statement. Being our first hackathon it was definitely a steep curve for us to catch up. It is an achievement to bring together creative minds to work through this project and we are proud of our growth.

We learnt how to go through an entire end to end user journey right from the start of when the user faces a problem and how our solutions can directly address the problem statement. More specifically how feature A solves problem A. Additionally, we learnt how to frame the value add brought to our solution making it stand out from existing as well as other newly proposed solutions.

Learning never stops and surely not for Elitehacks. We hope to learn from the kinks and grow as a team. Beyond the first round, subsequently we aim to gain feedback and upgrade to create better versions of our app with the intention to help our fellow Singaporeans.
